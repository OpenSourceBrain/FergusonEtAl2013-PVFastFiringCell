### Ferguson el al. 2013: PV+ fast-firing cell

Reference:
1 . Ferguson KA, Huh CY, Amilhon B, Williams S, Skinner FK (2013) Experimentally constrained CA1 fast-firing parvalbumin-positive interneuron network models exhibit sharp transitions into coherent high frequency rhythms. [Front Comput Neurosci 7:144](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2013.00144/abstract)

This two-variable simple model is derived based on patch-clamp recordings from the CA1 region of a whole hippocampus preparation of PV+ fast-firing cells. Since basket cells, axo-axonic cells and bistratified cells can be PV+ and fast-firing, this model could be representative of these cell types. 

#### Brian version of model

This model was originally developed in the [Brian simulator](http://briansimulator.org/):

#### NeuroML2/LEMS version of model

The model has been converted to NeuroML2/LEMS:
